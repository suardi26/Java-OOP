## Final Keyword

- <samp>The final keyword is a modifier to determine the behavior of classes, attributes and methods.</samp>

- <samp>Final Class is a class that cannot be passed down to another class.</samp>

- <samp>Final Variables are variables whose values cannot be changed either in the class or in the derived class.</samp>

  <samp>However, in Final variables can be inherited in their subclasses.</samp>
  
- <samp>Final Methods can be inherited in subclasses but cannot be overridden. Final methods can also be overloaded</samp> 
 
  <samp>but we recommend using the 'final' keyword in each overloaded method.</samp>
  
- <samp>Overridding Method is done by using a modifier that is the same as or wider than the modifier of the superclass.</samp> 
  
  <samp>For example, in a superclass using a default modifier (without using a modifier), the subclass must</samp> 
  
  <samp>use the default modifier or wider, such as public in the overridding method.</samp>
