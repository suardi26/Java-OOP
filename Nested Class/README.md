## Nested Class

- <samp>Nested class (nested class) is that there is a class within a class.</samp>

- <samp>Nested classes are created for when we want to create several interconnected classes,</samp>
 
  <samp>where classes cannot be created without other classes.</samp>
  
- <samp>Inner class is a class inside the class, while outer class is a class that is outside the inner class.</samp>

- <samp>For example, we will create a Duck class, and we need an Animal class, so we can create a Duck class as an Inner class</samp> 
 
  <samp>and an Animal class as an Outer class.</samp>
