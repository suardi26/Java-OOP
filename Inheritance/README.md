## Inheritance

- Inheritance is the process of inheriting attributes and methods from parent class to child class.
 
- A class that inherits its methods and attributes is called (super class, parent class, base class).
 
- Classes that inherit the methods and attributes of the super class are called (sub class, child class, derived class).
 
- To be able to inherit attributes and methods from the super class, you can use the keyword 'extends'.
