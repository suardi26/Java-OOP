## Reflection

- <samp>Reflection is the ability to see the structure of the application as it runs.</samp>

- <samp>Reflection allows us to check/view and modify the attributes of a class at runtime.</samp>

- <samp>Reflection is not only used to check/view information from classes, but can also be</samp> 

  <samp>used to check information from interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime.</samp>

- <samp>Reflection is usually very useful when we create a library or framework, so it can automate.</samp>

- <samp>To access the reflection class of an object, we can use the getClass() method which</samp> 

  <samp>is the default of the object class or the nameClass.class.</samp>

- <samp>The getClass method returns a class representation or information on the class at runtime of an object.</samp>

- <samp>For more details, please open project [Reflection](https://github.com/suardi26/Java-OOP/tree/main/Reflection/src/com/practice) in repositories suardi26/Java-OOP/Reflection/src/com/practice/.</samp>

- <samp>Have a nice day.</samp>
