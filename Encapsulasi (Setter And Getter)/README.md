## Encapsulasi (Setter And Getter)

- <samp>Encapsulation (Encapsulation) is a way to prevent data from being accessed from another class directly,</samp>
  
  <samp>where the data is wrapped in a private modifier so that data can only be accessed in its class. And to fill and retrieve</samp> 
  
  <samp>the data from other classes, a Setter method is needed to fill in the data and a Getter method to retrieve data.</samp>
  
- <samp>Encapsulation is necessary because :</samp>

    - <samp>To make it easier to control the attributes and methods of a class.</samp>

    - <samp>Attributes of a class such as variables can be made read-only (used to read/retrieve data with the Getter method),</samp> 
      
      <samp>or write only (used to write/fill data with the Setter method).</samp>
      
    - <samp>Flexibility (Programmers can change parts of the code without fear of impacting the rest of the code). <samp>
  
    - <samp>Increased security of data</samp>
