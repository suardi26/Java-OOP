## Anonymous Class

- <samp>Anonymous Class (class without a name) is the process of instantiating objects and declaring a class directly.</samp>

- <samp>Anonymous Class includes an Inner class, where the Outer class is the class where we create the anonymous Class.</samp>

- <samp>Anonymous classes can be used when creating simple interface or abstract class implementations, without having to create class implementations.</samp>

- <samp>Because the Anonymous class does not have a name, the Anonymous class cannot be used to reference an object/create an object.</samp>

- <samp>Anonymous classes are usually created when you don't want to implement an interface or abstract class in a </samp>
  
  <samp>different java file but instead implement it directly when the object is created/instance.</samp>
