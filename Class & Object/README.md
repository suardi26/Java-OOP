- <samp>class is a container to hold functions/methods and variables (attributes/properties).</samp> 

- <samp>Writing class names usually uses the PascalCase format. for example: class ProductList, class Product,</samp> 
 
  <samp>class Company, class FoodProduct.</samp>

- <samp>Object is a variable which is an instance of the class.</samp>

  <samp>which are objects such as smartphones that have attributes such as brand, type, color, etc. As well as behavior</samp> 
 
  <samp>such as playing music, sending messages, taking pictures.</samp>
