## Annotation

- <samp>Annotation is a tag to provide information on a code that is made.</samp>

- <samp>Annotation is the addition of metadata to the program code that we create.</samp>

- <samp>Annotations are usually used to create libraries/frameworks.</samp>

- <samp>Annotations can be accessed using reflection.</samp>

- <samp>When you want to create an annotation, you can use the @interface keyword.</samp>

- <samp>Annotations have methods with simple data types, and can have default values.</samp>

- <samp>Attribute Annotation :</samp>
       
  - <samp>@Target => is used to inform the annotation can be used on classes, methods, fields, etc.</samp>
    
    <samp>@Target has a value array or has more than one value.</samp>

  - <samp>@Retention => is used to inform that the annotation is stored in the compiled output, and is it readable by reflection ?.</samp> 
    
    <samp>@Retention has only one value.</samp>

- <samp>Some Annotation examples provided by java. like :</samp>
 
  - <samp>@Override is used to indicate that a method overrides a method from its superclass.</samp>

  - <samp>@Deprecated is used to indicate that the method is no longer recommended for use.</samp>

  - <samp>@FunctionalInterface, to indicate that the class can be created as a lambda expression.</samp>

  - <samp>etc.</samp>
