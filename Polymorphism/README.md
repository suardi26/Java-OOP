## Polymorphism

- <samp>Polymorphism is an ability where each subclass can recreate a method with the same name (Overridding) which is<s/amp> 

  <samp>inherited from the super class so that the contents of the inherited method can be different for each subclass.</samp>
  
- <samp>Polymorphism can be done when you have several classes related to each other through (Inheritance) inheritance.</samp>
  
  <samp>When a sub class inherits attributes and methods from a super class, polymorphism creates a new method with the same name</samp>
    
  <samp>for another or more specific task. Polymorphism allows us to perform one action in different ways.</samp>
