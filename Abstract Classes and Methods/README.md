## Abstract Classes and Methods

- <samp>The keyword 'abstract' is not an access modifier, and can be used in a class or method.</samp>

- <samp>Abstract class is a class that is still in abstract form or whose contents are only the basic form of</samp> 
 
  <samp>the class that will be used in each of its derived classes. Because the form is still abstract,</samp> 
  
  <samp>the abstract class cannot be used directly to create objects. but the contents of an</samp> 
  
  <samp>abstract class can be passed down to its sub class so that abstract methods from</samp> 
  
  <samp>its superclass can be made/implemented to be concrete or specific to its subclass.</samp>
  
- <samp>Abstract method is a method that has no implementation or no concrete form. in other words</samp> 
 
  <samp>abstract methods are methods that have no content and abstract methods can only be used in abstract classes.</samp>
  
- <samp>Because it has no content, the method is abstract, it must be overridden in the subclass, meaning to create</samp> 
  
  <samp>an abstract method in the superclass. force the derived class to override the abstract method.</samp>
  
- <samp>Abstract methods cannot have private access modifiers.</samp>

- <samp>Abstract classes are usually derived from ordinary classes, but abstract classes can also be derived from abstract classes.</samp>

- <samp>Have a nice day.</samp>
