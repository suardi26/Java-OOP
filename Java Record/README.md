## Java Record

- <samp>Java Record is used to create a class that contains data that has a getter, equals, hashCode and toString method.</samp>

- <samp>Java Record is used to store data and is immutability (cannot be changed) this is to ensure data validation.</samp>

- <samp>Java Records are usually used in database results, query results, and other data.</samp>

- <samp>Java Record has an attribute set in the class parameter which is constant/final and has private modifier</samp> 
  
  <samp>access so it cannot be accessed directly and cannot be changed anymore. but the data can be called with its getter method.</samp>

- <samp>To call the java record getter method, just write the attribute name followed by '()'.</samp>

- <samp>When creating a record class, Java will automatically generate getter, equals, hashCode,</samp> 

  <samp>and toString methods and constructors automatically.</samp>

- <samp>When creating a record class, it will automatically extend the java.lang.Record class, </samp>

  <samp>so it cannot extend other classes, but can implement interfaces.</samp>
       
- <samp>By default, the record class will create a constructor automatically according to the record/data definition in the class parameter.</samp>
