## Interface

- <samp>Same as abstract class, but interface only contains abstract methods (no code block) and constant attributes</samp> 
  
  <samp>(attribute values cannot be changed).</samp>
  
- <samp>To inherit the interface can use the keyword 'implements' instead of 'extends'. </samp>

- <samp>Interface also can not be used directly to create objects. but the contents of the</samp> 
  
  <samp>interface can be passed down to its sub class so that abstract methods from the superclass</samp> 
  
  <samp>can be made/implemented to be concrete or specific to the subclass.</samp>
  
- <samp>The default method on the interface is public and abstract.</samp>

- <samp>The default interface attribute is public static final.</samp>

- <samp>When implementing an interface, all methods in the interface must be overridden in its subclass.</samp>

- <samp>Since java 8 we can create interface methods that have implementation bodies using the 'default' keyword, by</samp> 
 
  <samp>creating a default method the subclass is not required to override. Only given the Option whether to Override or not.</samp>
  
- <samp>In the interface can not create a constructor.</samp>

- <samp>Since java 8 we can create static method in interface.</samp>

- <samp>Since java 9 we can create private methods in interfaces.</samp>

- <samp>In the interface we can apply the type of multiple inheritance.</samp>

- <samp>In java a subclass can only have 1 superclass, but unlike an interface, a subclass can implement more than 1 interface.</samp>

- <samp>Interfaces can inherit one or more interfaces, using the 'extends' keyword.</samp> 

  <samp>but when a class inherits an interface it uses the keyword 'implements'.</samp>

- <samp>Have a nice day.</samp>
