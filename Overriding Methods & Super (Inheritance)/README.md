## Overriding Methods & Super (Inheritance)

- <samp>Method Overriding is the process of remaking the methods inherited by the super class, so that the method can</samp>
  
  <samp>be used by the sub class more specifically according to the needs of the sub class itself.</samp>
  
- <samp>Method Overriding is usually created by adding the '@Override' annotation before method creation.</samp>

- <samp>Method Overridding is made by writing the same method name as the method name in the super class. So the method</samp> 
  
  <samp>in the super class is overridden by the overridding method in the sub class.</samp>
  
- <samp>The keyword 'this' is used to declare the attributes and methods that exist in the class.</samp>

- <samp>The keyword 'super' is used to declare the attributes and methods inherited from the super class.</samp>
